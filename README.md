Follow steps to create shopify Checkout extentions to modify checkout page..!

# Quick checklist before you start (ticklist)
-> Shopify Partner account (done) or shopify plus plan 
-> Dev store with Checkout Extensibility / Plus sandbox (if you need shipping/payment extension points)
-> Node.js (20.10+) + npm/pnpm/yarn + Git
-> Shopify CLI installed & logged in (shopify login --store your-dev-store.myshopify.com)
-> Code editor (VS Code)

# What is Shopify CLI?
  Shopify CLI = a command-line tool made by Shopify.
  It helps you create apps, generate checkout extensions, run them locally, connect to your dev store, and deploy.
  Without Shopify CLI, youâ€™d have to manually configure tunnels, uploads, app versions â€” very messy.
  So, itâ€™s the main tool to build Shopify apps and extensions.

# Why shopify login is necessary?
  Shopify CLI needs permission to connect your local code â†” Shopify Partner account + Dev store.
  When you run shopify login --store your-store.myshopify.com, it opens a browser, you log in, and then CLI gets an API token to:
  Install your app automatically in the dev store
  Preview extensions in checkout
  Deploy app versions
  ðŸ‘‰ Without login, CLI cannot push your extension to Shopify servers.

# Step-by-step commands (macOS/Linux)
# ðŸ‘‰ Step 1: Check if Node.js and Git are installed
node -v         # shows your Node.js version (must be >= 20.10)
git --version   # shows Git version (must be >= 2.28)

If missing:
sudo apt install nodejs npm git -y  
# Ubuntu/Debian

# ðŸ‘‰ Step 2: Install Shopify CLI globally
npm install -g @shopify/cli @shopify/app
# This installs the Shopify CLI tool which is required to create apps and extensions.

# ðŸ‘‰ Step 3: Verify Shopify CLI installation
shopify version
# This will display the installed Shopify CLI version to confirm itâ€™s working.

# ðŸ‘‰ Step 4: Login to your Shopify development store
shopify login --store your-store-name.myshopify.com
# This opens a browser window to log in to your Shopify Partner account.
# ðŸ‘‰ It connects your local project with your dev store so CLI can preview and deploy apps.

# ðŸ‘‰ Step 5: Create a new Shopify app project
npm init @shopify/app@latest my-app
cd my-app
# This scaffolds (creates) a Shopify app project with default files and setup.
# "cd my-app" moves you inside the new app folder.

# ðŸ‘‰ Step 6: Generate a Checkout UI Extension inside the app
shopify app generate extension --template checkout_ui --name my-checkout-extension
# This creates a new folder under "extensions/" with starter code for a checkout extension.
# ðŸ‘‰ This is where youâ€™ll write your extension logic (e.g., showing buttons in checkout).

# ðŸ‘‰ Step 7: Run the app in development mode
shopify app dev
# This will:
# - Open a Cloudflare tunnel
# - Install the app automatically into your dev store
# - Give you a link to preview the checkout extension live in checkout

# ðŸ‘‰ Step 8: (Optional) Serve only the extension
shopify extension serve
# Runs just the extension (instead of the whole app) for faster development.

# ðŸ‘‰ Step 9: Build and deploy your app + extension
shopify app deploy
# This builds your project, creates an "app version" on Shopifyâ€™s servers, and deploys it.
# ðŸ‘‰ After this step, your extension can be used in your store or submitted to Shopify.

store ke sath link hona jruri hai, app ko generate krne k baad app install krna jruri hai
