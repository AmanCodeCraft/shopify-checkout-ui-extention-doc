ðŸ”¹ What is Shopify CLI?
  Shopify CLI = a command-line tool made by Shopify.
  It helps you create apps, generate checkout extensions, run them locally, connect to your dev store, and deploy.
  Without Shopify CLI, youâ€™d have to manually configure tunnels, uploads, app versions â€” very messy.
  So, itâ€™s the main tool to build Shopify apps and extensions.
